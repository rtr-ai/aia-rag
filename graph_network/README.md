# Interactive network visualization of AiAct

### Introduction

Each node represents a single chunk of textual data that has been fed into the vector store. The process of chunking the data was largely manual to achieve an optimal structure for the embeddings. Each chunk corresponds to a specific unit, such as a chapter (Kapitel), section (Abschnitt), article (Artikel), or similar. Additionally, each chunk contains information about its relationship to other chunks (Querweise).

In the visualization, each node represents an individual embedding (e.g., chapter, section), while the connecting lines between nodes (entities) depict the relationships between two or more nodes.
