# Getting Started with Annotation Tool

This project provides a tool for manually chunking texts for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) usages.

It is indeed to be run in Docker container.
To rebuild the container when starting, please use `docker compose up --build` options.

## Available Scripts (Inside the container)

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
