# Chunk Comparison Tool

This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed to compare chunks between true results and those generated by a chatbot. The tool converts markdown data to JSON, imports and evaluates chatbot results, and then compares both sets of data to highlight matches and discrepancies.

## Overview

The project workflow is as follows:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Run the `requirements.txt` file to install necessary Python libraries.
2. **Generate True Results:** Execute `md_to_json.py` to convert your markdown file(s) into a `true_results.json` file.
3. **Generate Chatbot Results:** Run `import_requests.py` to create the `evaluated_results.json` file, which contains results from the chatbot.
4. **Compare Results:** Finally, run `app.py` to compare the `true_results.json` with `evaluated_results.json` and output a detailed report.

## Repository Structure

- **requirements.txt**: Lists all dependencies required for the project.
- **md_to_jdson.py**: Converts markdown input into a JSON file (`true_results.json`) that contains the expected results.
- **import_request.py**: Processes and evaluates chatbot output, saving the results to `evaluated_results.json`.
- **app.py**: Compares the `true_results.json` with `evaluated_results.json` to identify discrepancies and matches.
- Additional files and folders may be present to support the project functionality.
